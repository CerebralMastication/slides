* Can we categorize flights as:

  * THEN `late`

# How might we do this in Excel?

* First attempt

```{r, eval = FALSE}
=IF(H2 <= 0, "early", IF(AND(H2>0, H2<=50), "late", IF(H2>50,"really late")))
```

--

* If you know about ALT+ENTER to align nicely

```{r, eval = FALSE}
=IF(H2 <= 0,           "early", 
 IF(AND(H2>0, H2<=50), "late", 
 IF(H2>50,             "really late")))
```

--

* If you understand that the order matters

```{r, eval = FALSE}
=IF(H2<=0, "early",
 IF(H2<=50,"late",
           "really late"))
```

# Even Excel knows the deal

* Error prone:

  * "It might work 75% of the time, but return unexpected results 25% of the time. _Unfortunately, the odds of you catching the 25% are slim._"

--

* Maintenance / Documentation

  * "Multiple IF statements can become incredibly difficult to maintain, _especially when you come back some time later and try to figure out what you, or worse someone else, was trying to do._"

--

* Speed

  * They are really slow. >1 second for 3 conditions and ~320,000 rows

--

* Just don't

  * "If you find yourself with an IF statement that just seems to keep growing with no end in sight, _itâ€™s time to put down the mouse and rethink your strategy._"

# group_by() and summarize()

* Often, data sets are grouped and aggregated to get a coarser level of insights

* Think _pivot tables_ from Excel

* In R, these manipulations are accomplished using _grouped data frames_.

![](img/group_summary.png)

class: dv

# group_by() and summarize()

* For `flights`, what if we wanted the average `distance` for each `month`?


```{r, eval = FALSE}
flights_late %>%
  group_by(month) %>%                      # Group rows by month 1, 2, ..., 12
  summarize(avg_distance = mean(distance), # For each group, avg distance
            avg_delay    = mean(delay))
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
flights_late %>%
  group_by(month) %>%                      # Group rows by month 1, 2, ..., 12
  summarize(avg_distance = mean(distance), # For each group, avg distance
            avg_delay    = mean(delay)) %>%

# Tidy data

* There are three interrelated rules which make a dataset tidy:

      1. Each _variable_ must have its own _column_.

      2. Each _observation_ must have its own _row_.
  
      3. Each _value_ must have its own _cell_.
    
![](./img/tidy.png)

* Tidy data makes your analysis steps feel natural

---

class: dv

# Tidy VS Untidy example

```{r}
library(readxl)
de <- read_excel(path = "data/example_de.xlsx")

head(de)
```

* Not tidy! Think about performing a `group_by` to get the average de for each product. Can't group on columns!

# Tidying up - gather() and spread()

![](./img/gather.png)

class: dv

# Tidying up - gather() and spread()

* `gather()` multiple columns together

```{r}
de %>% 
  gather(key = product, value = de, -scenario, -year)
```

class: dv

# Tidying up - gather() and spread()

```{r}

  group_by(product, scenario) %>%
  summarise(pvde = pv.uneven(r = .05, cf = -de))

* Also, visualizations are built around data being in this form
